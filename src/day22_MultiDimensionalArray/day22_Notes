Java Day22
Topic: Multi Dimensional Array

package name: day22_MultiDimensionalArray

warmup task:
	1. Write a program that can reverse a sentence
			Ex:
				sentence = "Today is a good day to learn Java";

			output:
				Java learn to day good a is Today


	2. Write a program that can reverse the second word of the sentence
			Ex:
				sentence = "I Love Java";

			output:
				I evoL Java


Single Dimensional Array: container for the elemnts
		10
		20
		40

		int[] array = {10, 20, 30};


Multi Dimensional Array: container for the arrays

Array: one of the three data structures
		size is fixed
		supports primitives & non-primitives
		can be multi-dimensional

--------------------------------------------------

	one dimensional array: array of elements
			[index Of Elements]

	multi-dimensional array: array of arrays. two or more dimensional ([][]..)
			[index of Arrays][index Of Elements]
			[][][]
			.....

			n dimensional array contains (n-1) dimensional array


Arrays: utility class for array. in "java.util" package

		toString()
		deepToString()
		sort()
		equals()
		copyOf()
		copyOfRange()


String methods:
	toCharArray()
	split()


for each loop: already iterated
			    iteration order is fixed

			    THERE MUST BE A DATA STRUCTURE

			    for(DataType variable : Array){

			    }
